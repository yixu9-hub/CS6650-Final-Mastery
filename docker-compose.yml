  # Note: receiver and processor services are deployed via Terraform to LocalStack ECS
  # This ensures consistent architecture between LocalStack and AWS environments
  # Services are accessible at:
  #   - Receiver: http://localhost:8080 (via LocalStack ALB)
  #   - Processor: runs as ECS task, consumes from SQS
  # To view ECS services: aws ecs list-services --cluster ordersystem-cluster --endpoint-url http://localhost:4566
